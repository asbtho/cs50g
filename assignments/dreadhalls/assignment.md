- Spawn holes in the floor of the maze that the player can fall through (but not too many; just three or four per maze is probably sufficient, depending on maze size).
    - .
- When the player falls through any holes, transition to a “Game Over” screen similar to the Title Screen, implemented as a separate scene.
    - .
- When the player presses “Enter” in the “Game Over” scene, they should be brought back to the title.
    - .
- Add a Text label to the Play scene that keeps track of which maze they’re in, incrementing each time they progress to the next maze. This can be implemented as a static variable, but it should be reset to 0 if they get a Game Over.
